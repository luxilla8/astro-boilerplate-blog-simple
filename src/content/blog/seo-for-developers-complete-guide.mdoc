SEO isn't just for marketers. As developers, we control the technical foundations that determine whether a site can rank well. Here's everything you need to know.

## The Technical Foundations

Before we dive into tactics, understand this: Google (and other search engines) are essentially trying to understand what your page is about and whether it's trustworthy. Everything we do is in service of making that easier.

### 1. Semantic HTML

This is the foundation. Use the right elements:

```html
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Your Page Title</h1>
    <time datetime="2024-01-08">January 8, 2024</time>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>First Section</h2>
    <p>Content goes here...</p>
  </section>
</article>
```

Key elements to use correctly:
- `<article>` for standalone content
- `<nav>` for navigation
- `<main>` for primary content
- `<aside>` for sidebars
- `<header>` and `<footer>` for their obvious purposes

### 2. Meta Tags That Matter

Not all meta tags are created equal. Focus on these:

```html
<!-- Essential -->
<title>Page Title | Site Name</title>
<meta name="description" content="150-160 character description">
<link rel="canonical" href="https://yoursite.com/page">

<!-- Open Graph (for social sharing) -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Page Title">
<meta property="og:description" content="Description">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yoursite.com/image.jpg">
<meta property="og:type" content="article">

<!-- Twitter Cards -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
```

### 3. Structured Data (JSON-LD)

This is where you can really stand out. Structured data helps search engines understand your content:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "headline": "Your Article Title",
  "datePublished": "2024-01-08",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Author Name"
  }
}
</script>
```

Use the [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/) to test your markup.

## Core Web Vitals

Google uses these metrics as ranking signals:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
*Target: < 2.5 seconds*

The time it takes for the main content to load. Improve it by:
- Optimizing images (use WebP, proper sizing)
- Preloading critical resources
- Using a CDN

### Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
*Target: < 200 milliseconds*

How quickly your site responds to user input. Improve it by:
- Minimizing JavaScript
- Breaking up long tasks
- Using web workers for heavy computation

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
*Target: < 0.1*

How much the page layout shifts during load. Prevent it by:
- Setting explicit dimensions on images and videos
- Reserving space for dynamic content
- Avoiding inserting content above existing content

## Making Your Site AI-Discoverable

This is the new frontier. AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity are increasingly surfacing content. Here's how to optimize for them:

### 1. Create an llms.txt File

```markdown
# Site Name

> Brief description of your site

## Key Sections
- [Blog](/blog) - Latest articles
- [Documentation](/docs) - Technical guides

## Recent Content
- [Article Title](/blog/article) - Description
```

### 2. Don't Block AI Crawlers

In your robots.txt:
```
User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: Claude-Web
Allow: /
```

### 3. Write Clear, Factual Content

AI systems favor content that is:
- Well-structured with clear headings
- Factually accurate and up-to-date
- Free of excessive marketing fluff
- Comprehensive on the topic

## Technical Checklist

Before launching any page:

- [ ] Unique, descriptive `<title>` tag (50-60 characters)
- [ ] Compelling meta description (150-160 characters)
- [ ] Canonical URL set
- [ ] Open Graph tags for social sharing
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Page loads in under 3 seconds
- [ ] Mobile-friendly design
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] XML sitemap submitted

## Conclusion

SEO isn't magic—it's engineering. Build fast, accessible sites with clear structure, and you're already ahead of most of the web.
