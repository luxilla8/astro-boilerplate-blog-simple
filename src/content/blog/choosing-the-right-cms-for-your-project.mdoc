Choosing a CMS is one of those decisions that seems simple until you're knee-deep in options. Let's cut through the noise and figure out what actually matters.

## The CMS Landscape in 2024

The days of WordPress-or-nothing are long gone. Today's options fall into a few categories:

1. **Traditional CMS** - WordPress, Drupal (database-backed, monolithic)
2. **Headless CMS** - Contentful, Sanity, Strapi (API-first, decoupled)
3. **Git-based CMS** - Keystatic, Tina, Decap (files in your repo)
4. **Hybrid** - Payload, Directus (self-hosted, flexible)

Each has its place. Let's break them down.

## Git-Based CMS: The Developer's Choice

This is where Keystatic shines. Your content lives as files in your Git repository—Markdown, YAML, JSON, whatever makes sense.

### Pros
- **Version control** - Full history of every change
- **No database** - One less thing to manage
- **Works offline** - Edit locally, push when ready
- **No vendor lock-in** - Your content is just files
- **Free** - No per-seat pricing

### Cons
- **Requires Git knowledge** - (or a visual editor like Keystatic)
- **Build times** - Large sites take longer to build
- **Real-time updates** - Requires a rebuild to see changes

### Best for
- Developer blogs and documentation
- Small to medium content sites
- Teams comfortable with Git workflows
- Projects with limited budgets

## Headless CMS: The Enterprise Standard

Platforms like Contentful and Sanity are the go-to for larger organizations.

### Pros
- **Real-time updates** - Changes publish instantly
- **Rich editing experience** - Great for non-technical editors
- **Scalable** - Handle millions of entries
- **API-first** - Use content anywhere

### Cons
- **Cost** - Can get expensive quickly
- **Vendor lock-in** - Your content lives on their servers
- **Complexity** - More moving parts to manage
- **Build requirements** - Need to set up API connections

### Best for
- Enterprise content operations
- Teams with dedicated content editors
- Multi-channel publishing
- Sites requiring real-time updates

## The Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Keystatic | Contentful | Sanity | Strapi |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| Pricing | Free | $$ | $$ | Free (self-hosted) |
| Hosting | Your repo | Cloud | Cloud | Self-hosted |
| Real-time | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Version control | Built-in | Limited | Limited | Limited |
| Learning curve | Low | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Editor UX | Good | Excellent | Excellent | Good |

## Questions to Ask

Before choosing, answer these:

### 1. Who will edit content?
- Developers only? → Git-based CMS
- Marketing team? → Headless with good UI
- Mix? → Consider the editing experience carefully

### 2. How often does content change?
- Weekly/monthly? → Git-based is fine
- Multiple times daily? → Headless makes more sense

### 3. What's your budget?
- Bootstrap/indie? → Git-based or self-hosted
- Funded startup? → Headless is viable
- Enterprise? → Budget probably isn't the constraint

### 4. How technical is your team?
- Very technical? → Git-based gives you full control
- Mixed skills? → Prioritize the editing experience

## My Recommendation

For most developer-led projects—blogs, documentation, marketing sites—**start with a Git-based CMS like Keystatic**.

Here's why:
- Zero ongoing cost
- Content lives in your repo forever
- Visual editing for non-technical collaborators
- Easy to migrate if you outgrow it

You can always upgrade to a headless CMS later if you need real-time updates or more sophisticated content modeling. But most sites never reach that point.

## Getting Started with Keystatic

If you want to try Keystatic with Astro, here's the quick start:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
npx @keystatic/cli init
```

You'll have a working CMS in minutes, with content stored right in your project.

## Conclusion

The "best" CMS is the one that fits your team, budget, and workflow. Don't over-engineer it—start simple and evolve as your needs grow.

For content-focused sites built by developers, Git-based CMSes like Keystatic offer the best balance of simplicity, control, and cost. Give it a try.
